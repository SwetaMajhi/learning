# small stuffs I am learning about shell commands
So when we see a command it can be:
1. an executable progam like the .bin, .sh, .py files
2. shell builtins
3. a shell function
4. OR an alias
and the type command can tell me that!

And if I want to know the location of these commands?  
Use which command (works for executables but not builtins)

What if I need help?  
You can get help for shell builtin commands

So you won't help me with executable command?  
[help grep]
I would if you show some patience while learning this shit!  
[grep help]  

or even better, search for manual using man command  

I don't know. I might wanna search all the manual pages with a specific keyword  
[grep man]  

Can I get a shorter description?
Use whatis

You know you can append multiple commands in a single line, separating them via semicolon right! Well we can use it to create aliases, so you won't have to type repetitive commands every time  
[alias]  

type unalias buildA, to remove your alias  

I might not remember the name, can I see all aliases in the environment?  
[alias list]  
  
Thought you should know, their lifespan is only as till your session doesn't end.  
Excuse me! My lazy ass is looking for a long term solution here!
