1st there is program.
a program consists of multiple processes. a process is program in execution.
each process can have multiple threads. always has at least 1 thread.

thread is the smallest unit of execution, to which processor allocates time.
it consists of
a thread id
a resgister set
program counter
stack

when multiple threads part of a process, they share
-code section (duh! you all are supposed to follow the same logic)
?-data section (variable)
?-operating system resources like: files, signals etc. //what are signals

ex. when using web browser application, 1 thread is displaying info, another is downloading file into my system

Benefits of multi threading:
may allow the process to keep running, even though a part of it is working on some extensive task, hence improving the responsive of application
by resource sharing, we are making our system more efficient, the code, datam file which could have been used by just 1 threas that would gave taken time, now is being shared by multiple threads.
